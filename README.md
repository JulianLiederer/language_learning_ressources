# Language Learning Ressources

You want to learn a language but you're not sure where to start? Here you can find methods that worked for me in my language learning journey.

## Passive Understanding

To get an passive understanding of a language and get a natural grip of the use of a language it's best to surround yourself with it. Good methods are for example:

* Watching childrens cartoons in the language while working
* Listening to music in the language
* Going on holidays in the country where the language is spoken (unfortunately not pandemic-friendly)
* listening to podcasts in the language
* watching youtube videos about topics you're interested and also familiar with
